## My Recommendation

**Top 3 choices for LOT:**

1. **Option 8 (Constellation)** - Fits LOT's theme of guidance, navigation, patterns. Stars suggest orientation in psychological space.

2. **Option 1 (Geometric)** - Clean, modern, very readable. Geometric patterns suggest structure and growth.

3. **Option 7 (Zen Garden)** - Meditative quality fits introspective nature of LOT. Calming patterns.

**Avoid:**
- Option 2 (too technical/architectural)
- Option 3 (too mathematical/academic)
