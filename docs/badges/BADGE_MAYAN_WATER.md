# Mayan Water / Cosmic Badge System

**Philosophy:** Badges inspired by Mayan vigesimal counting, water cycles, and cosmic/alien aesthetics. Each badge represents cyclical growth through fluid, otherworldly patterns.

---

## Core Concept: Mayan Dot-Bar System

Mayan numerals use:
- **Dot (•)** = 1
- **Bar (―)** = 5
- **Shell** = 0 (completion/cycle)

Combined with **water droplets**, **waves**, and **cosmic symbols** for an alien, fluid progression.

## Option A: Aquatic Mayan (Water Droplets + Bars)

### Milestone Badges (Days)
```
7 days:    ∘∘    (two droplets - first cycle)
30 days:   ∘≋    (droplet + wave - flowing cycle)
100 days:  ≋≋    (double wave - mastery flow)
```

### Pattern Badges (Behavioral)
```
Balanced:     ∘―∘    (droplet-bar-droplet: equilibrium)
Flow:         ≈∘≈    (waves embracing droplet: fluid state)
Consistent:   ―∘―    (bar-droplet-bar: steady rhythm)
Reflective:   ∘◯∘    (nested circles: inner/outer awareness)
Explorer:     ∘⋯∘    (droplet-dots-droplet: scattered curiosity)

## Comparison: Mayan-Inspired Options

| **B: Cosmic Mayan** | Alien geometry | Traditional dots/bars | Low water, high alien | High |
| **C: Liquid Cycles** | Pure water | Cycle philosophy | Very high water | High |
| **D: Alien Vigesimal** | Space/cosmic | Base-20 inspired | Low water, very high alien | Medium-High |
| **E: Oceanic Mayan** | Ancient water | Direct dots/bars/circles | Very high water | Very High |

## Mayan Progression Philosophy

### Traditional Mayan Counting (Vertical):
```
20 = •     (one dot in second position)
     —     (one bar = 5 in first position)

13 = ••• (3 dots)
     —— (2 bars = 10)
```

### Applied to Badge Progression:
```
Day 1-6:    Building dots (∘)
Day 7:      First completion (∘∘ or ◦―)
Day 8-29:   Second cycle building
Day 30:     Major cycle (≈∘≈ or ◦―◦)
Day 100:    Mastery cycle (≋≋ or ―◦―)
```
